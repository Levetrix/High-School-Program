					    </ul>
				    </div>
				    <div class="scroll" id="apply2">
						<h4>What should I know before I apply</h4>
						<ul>
					      <li>BYU  Independent Study high school courses are secular in nature; your religious  affiliation will not factor into determining your eligibility to participate in  our high school programs.</li>
					      <li>You should  not apply to any of our programs if you are seeking NCAA, NJCAA, NAIA, etc.,  eligibility (or may do so in the future).</li>
					      <li>Although our  courses are accredited and accepted by most colleges and universities, you  should always consult with your potential college before enrolling.</li>
					      <li>Due to the  nature of distance education, we cannot designate your student status as part  time or full time, nor can we fill out any non-BYU forms verifying your status,  etc. Before applying to a program, you should verify that your lack of  part-time or full-time student status will not disqualify you from any benefits  to which you would otherwise be entitled.</li>
					      <li>High school  credits you have earned from other accredited schools are generally  transferable and will be evaluated for possible credit toward your program  requirements.</li>
					      <li>Each program  is designed to be a four-year course of study, but you may complete the program  requirements in less time.</li>
					      <li>All students  are required to enroll in STDEV 051 to become better prepared to succeed in distance  learning. It is recommended that students enroll in this course first.</li>
					      <li>Completion of a BYU Independent Study high  school program fulfills high school requirements as defined by the State of  Utah.</li>
					      <li>Students can register for courses and the skills  assessment test (TABE 041) by calling our Registration Department at  1-877-221-6716.</li>
					      <li>Students accepted into the Adult High School  Diploma Program should register for the TABE 041 skills assessment test within  30 days of receiving their acceptance letter.</li>
					      <li>Adult High School Diploma Program requirements  are subject to change as deemed necessary by the Provo (Utah) School District.</li>
					      <li>We reserve the right to cancel your enrollment  in a program at any time for reasons including (but not limited to) plagiarism,  dishonesty, falsifying documents, etc.</li>
					    </ul>
				    </div>
				    <div class="scroll" id="apply3">
					    <h4>What are the qualifications for the Adult&nbsp;Program</h4>
					    <p><strong>The Adult High School Diploma Program</strong></p>
					    <ul>
					      <li>Requires you to be at  least 19 years old when applying</li>
					      <li>Requires that you be a  United States citizen or United States permanent resident</li>
					      <li>Requires you to complete  a minimum of two courses every six months (a program extension may be granted  when extenuating circumstances arise)</li>
					      <li>Requires that you  complete a minimum of 2.0 BYU Independent Study credit hours, regardless of the  number of credits earned at other schools </li>
					      <li>Requires that you take  and pass a basic skills assessment test (TABE: Test of Adult Basic Education).  Students accepted into the program should register for the test within 30 days  of receiving their acceptance letter. </li>
					      <li>Qualifies you to earn a  high school diploma from the Provo (Utah) School District</li>
					      <li><strong>Utah residents</strong> who take and pass the GED test after June 30, 2009, are no longer  eligible to apply to the Adult High School Diploma Program. The GED becomes  their Utah High School Completion diploma. Current students who choose to take  the GED and pass the test will be withdrawn from the program. Students who fail  the test may apply to or remain in the Adult Diploma Program. This policy  change does not affect those living in other states who either pass or fail the  test.</li>
					    </ul>
					    <p><strong>Adult High School Diploma Students’ Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE)</strong> <br>
					      Before you can receive your diploma, you  must pass a basic skills assessment test called the TABE: Test of Adult Basic  Education. The TABE measures your ability level in the areas of math, English,  and reading. The test may be requested by calling our Registration Department  at 1-877-221-6716 and paying a $10 registration fee. The TABE must be taken  with a BYU Independent Study-approved proctor and may be retaken as many times  as necessary. The cost for each retake is $10.<strong> </strong></p>
				    </div>
				    <div class="scroll" id="apply4">
					    <h4>How long does it take to get accepted into the&nbsp;program</h4>
					    The application acceptance process usually takes a minimum of 3 weeks, but can often take a month or more during peak enrollment seasons.
				    </div>
				    <div class="scroll" id="gen1">
					    <h4>How do the high school programs&nbsp;work</h4>
					    <ul>
					      <li>Apply for  admission to the specific high school program for which you are qualified to  apply or the one that best fits your needs: the Standard Program, the Advanced  Program, or the Adult High School Diploma Program. Include your official  transcript from all previously attended high schools.</li>
					      <li>Application  processing time is a minimum of three weeks (depending on applicant volume). <br>
					      </li>
					      <li>Receive your  Welcome Packet, which includes an acceptance letter explaining how to proceed  in your program as well as a Student Progress Report (SPR) that lists any  previously taken course(s) that has (have) been accepted for credit toward your  program.&nbsp; </li>
					      <li>Choose the  courses you would like to enroll in after comparing your Student Progress  Report with your program’s Academic Plan. </li>
					      <li>If you would  like help choosing your courses, you may reach a High School Programs advisor  by calling 801-422-8122.</li>
					      <li>Enroll in a  minimum of two to five courses (depending on your program requirements),  complete your coursework, and pass your exams. You will need to pass and  complete at least six courses every six months to complete your program in four  years.</li>
					      <li>Successfully  meet program requirements by completing 24 credit hours in specified subject  areas.</li>
					      <li>Receive an  official transcript and completion letter once you complete the Standard  Program or the Advanced Program. If you are in the Adult High School Diploma  Program, you will receive your high school diploma after completing all program  requirements.<strong> </strong></li>
					    </ul>
				    </div>
				    <div class="scroll" id="gen2">
					    <h4>What is the difference between a high school transcript and&nbsp;diploma</h4>
					    <p><strong>Transcript</strong></p>
					    <ul>
					      <li>A transcript is an  official document that shows the courses you have taken, the grades earned, and  a cumulative grade point average (GPA). A transcript is not a diploma.</li>
					      <li>Most colleges require  that you submit a transcript, not a diploma, as part of the college admissions  process. Although most colleges and universities accept transcripts from our  high school programs, you should always consult with your potential college or  university before applying to any of our programs.</li>
					    <li>To request a transcript of all your coursework, print and fill out a  Transcript Request Form found <a href="/site/courses/ordertrans.cfm">here</a>.</li></ul>
					    <p><strong>Diploma</strong></p>
					    <ul>
					      <li>A diploma is an official  document that certifies that you have successfully completed a particular  course of study.</li>
					      <li>The diploma earned after  completing the Adult High School Diploma Program verifies that you have  satisfied the high school curriculum standards as defined by the State of Utah.  It also verifies that you have successfully passed the TABE (Test of Adult  Basic Education).<strong> </strong></li>
					    </ul>
				    </div>
				    <div class="scroll" id="gen3">
					    <h4>Can I still my local high school for certain&nbsp;courses</h4>
					    <p>Once you have been accepted into a high school program,  it is recommended that you complete your remaining course requirements through  us. However, if we do not offer a particular course that you would like to  take, such as band, drama, choir, etc., you may request approval to enroll in  this course at another institution by contacting High School Programs Academic  Administrator, Joseph Roberson, at <strong>joseph.roberson@byu.edu</strong>.</p>
				    </div>
				    <div class="scroll" id="gen4">
					    <h4>What additional program policies should I know</h4>
						    <p><strong>Allowing Courses to Expire</strong><br>
						      If you allow a course to expire, an "F" will appear on your transcript  and will be calculated into your GPA. The word "Expired" will also be noted on  the transcript.</p>
						    <p><strong>Withdrawing from a program or course </strong><br>
						      You can withdraw from our program by contacting us at  1-855-381-2621 (toll free) or 801-422-8122 (local). You may also send us an  e-mail at is_highschoolprograms@byu.edu.<br><br>
						
						If you need to withdraw from a course, you may do so at any  time as long as you have not requested the final exam or completed the course.<br>
						<br>
						If you request a withdrawal within 60 days of registering,  you will receive a refund minus a $20 processing fee for each high school  course. The course will not appear on your transcript.<br>
						<br>
						If you withdraw from a course after the first 60 days, no  refund will be granted. The course will remain on your transcript and the word  "Withdrawn" will be noted on the transcript. A "Withdrawn" course does not  affect your GPA.</p>
						If you would like to request a transcript of all  your coursework, you may print and fill out a <a href="/site/courses/ordertrans.cfm">Transcript Request form</a>.   
					</div>
					<div class="scroll" id="gen5">
						<h4>How do I earn a high school program scholarship&nbsp;course</h4>
						<p>Effective September 1, 2012, high school program students  will be eligible to receive one free scholarship course for every five courses  they complete with a B or higher grade through BYU Independent Study.<br>
							<br>
							A list of eligible courses is available on our website.<br>
							<br>
							Some of the scholarship courses require textbooks and other  materials that students will need to purchase separately. Such requirements are  found in the course descriptions. They will also be responsible for purchasing  any optional printed student guides.<br>
							<br>
							Students who qualify for scholarship courses will pay  approximately $660 per half year (six courses).
